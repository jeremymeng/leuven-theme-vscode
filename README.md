# Leuven Theme for VS Code

This is a port of [emacs-leuven-theme](https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme) for VS Code.

This repo also uses copies of demo files from [Shades of Purple](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode).

Thanks to Emacs community for all the awesome work!

**Enjoy!**
